🧪 Windows Event Log Analysis Using PowerShell
Overview

This lab demonstrates how to analyze, filter, and export Windows Event Logs using PowerShell, without relying on the Event Viewer GUI.

The goal is to showcase real-world systems administration and incident response workflows using console-first techniques that are applicable to Windows Server environments, remote administration scenarios, and security investigations.

All commands are designed to be:

Practical

Reproducible

Useful in real operational environments

Platform

Windows Server 2022 (GUI or Core)

PowerShell (run as Administrator)

While demonstrated on Windows Server 2022, most commands also apply to modern Windows client systems.

Lab Objectives

Enumerate available Windows event logs

Query System and Security logs using PowerShell

Filter events by:

Event ID

Time range

Severity level

Provider

Identify:

Service failures

System reboots

Failed and successful logons

Privileged logons

After-hours activity

Scheduled task execution

Export event data to CSV for reporting and documentation

Simulate real-world troubleshooting and incident response scenarios

Why This Matters

In many production environments:

GUI access is limited or unavailable

Servers are managed remotely

Administrators need fast, scriptable insight into system behavior

Logs must be collected as evidence, not just viewed

This lab demonstrates how PowerShell can be used as a primary event analysis tool, not just an alternative to Event Viewer.
